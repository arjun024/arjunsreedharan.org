<p>I was once writing program similar to the following. But i made a little mistake which led me to something interesting.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main()
{
  char ch[256];
  scanf("%s", ch);
  if (ch == 'a') {
    printf("Your sentence begins with %c.\n", *ch);
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>In this code; i am supposedly reading a string from <code>stdin</code>, checking if it begins with the character literal <code>'a'</code> and if it does, print something.<br/><br/> However, if you watch closely enough i missed an asterisk on line 7.<br/>It should have been <code>if (*ch == 'a') {</code></p>
<p>Not noticing the bug i went on and compiled the code.<br/><br/> GCC threw the following warning:<br/><code>warning: comparison between pointer and integer</code><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="//static.tumblr.com/gltvynn/J4in62jiu/charint.png"/> Now i knew where to fix, but the warning caught my attention.</p>
<p>It says i am trying to compare a <strong>pointer</strong> and an <strong>integer</strong>.<br/> But where does the <strong>integer</strong> come from?</p>
<p>I am not using an integer anywhere in the code except for the return value of <code>main()</code>.</p>
<p>In the line which throws the warning, i am comparing a pointer (<code>ch</code>) to a character literal (<code>'a'</code>).</p>
<p><br/><br/><br/>A little bit of investigation around the web and i found out why.</p>
<p>Before i tell you why, let me try to find the size of the character literal compared to that of an <code>int</code> and <code>char</code>.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">int main()
{
  printf("sizeof(char) %d\n", sizeof(char));
  printf("sizeof(int) %d\n", sizeof(int));
  printf("sizeof('a') %d\n", sizeof('a'));
  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>Here&#8217;s the output:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">sizeof(char) 1
sizeof(int) 4
sizeof('a') 4
</pre>
<p>As you can see, the character literal doesn&#8217;t occupy the size of a <code>char</code>, it takes the size of an <code>int</code>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the C standard says (ยง6.4.4.4):</p>
<pre>    883 An integer character constant has type int.
    
    ...
    
    886 If an integer character constant contains a single
    character or escape sequence, its value is the one that 
    results when an object with type char whose value is that of 
    the single character or escape sequence is converted to 
    type int.
</pre>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p>Yes. In <strong>C</strong>, a character literal is an <code>int</code> not a <code>char</code>.</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong><br/>The same is not true for <strong>C++</strong>. see the screenshot below.<br/><img alt="image" src="//static.tumblr.com/gltvynn/ZTNn62jk5/candcc.png"/></p>
